# Troposphere Script Collection

## Description

This repository serves as a place to store and distribute scripts for building
out bits of infrastructure using troposphere. At present, this is just a small
proof of concept. I'm working now to create a modular VPC manufacturer. Of
course we're talking about generating CloudFormation (CFN) templates as our
output, but a goal is to automate the deployment of segments of infrastructure
without needing to store or think very much about generated templates.
